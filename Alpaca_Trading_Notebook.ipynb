        "1.  **Security:** Your API keys are not directly exposed in the notebook, preventing accidental commits to version control or unauthorized access.\n",
        "2.  **Convenience:** Once stored, secrets can be easily accessed in any Colab notebook without re-entering them.\n",

        "\n",
        "**How to set up Colab Secrets:**\n",
        "1.  On the left sidebar of your Colab notebook, click the '🔑 Secrets' icon.\n",
        "2.  Click '+ New secret'.\n",
        "3.  For `Name`, enter `APCA_API_KEY_ID` and for `Value`, paste your Alpaca API Key ID.\n",
